Hello! If you've found this without me giving you the link, good for you. This is just a repo to help teach some of my newer friends some comp-sci basics with c so its not meant to be an end-all be-all guide or anything.

# Setup
These are the guides you should follow for setting up the environment needed for most of these guides
1. [Setup WSL](<./Setup/Setup WSL.md>)
2. [Install Compilers](./Setup/Compilers.md)
3. [VSCode with WSL](<./Setup/VSCode WSL.md>)

# First Steps

Before checking out [Lab1](<./Labs/Lab1.md>) I highly recommend reading:
1. [Variables](<./Ideas/Variables.md>)
2. [Loops](<./Ideas/Loops.md>)
3. [The Main function](<./Explanations/Main%20Function.md>)
4. [Printf Basics](<./Explanations/Basic%20Printf.md>)
