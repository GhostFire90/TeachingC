`printf` is one of the most important functions included in C. Its, as it is named, prints stuff to the screen.
```c
int main(void){
	printf("Hello World!");
}
```
This simply prints "Hello World!" to the screen, however `printf` has more uses than that.

# Variable output

So what if we have a variable `int a = 5` and we want to print it to screen?
```c
printf("a")
```
