## Definition 
A Variable in C is anything that stores a value, whether its a number, some text, a single letter, or a decimal number (they are different sadly)

Some example definitions
```c
int i = 0;

float f = 0.0f;

char c = 'A';
char* str = "Hello World";

```

there are a lot of new words and symbols in that block of code so let me break down a variable declaration in some more complex terms
```c
//int is the type of data the variable stores, in this case it stands for integer
//i is the name of the variable
// = 0 is optional most of the timeÂ®, but in this case it sets the variable to 0 immediately
int i = 0;
```
so the way you declare a variable goes like this
```c
//int       i
<var type> <var name>;
```
## Types

### Integer
Type in c: `int`
What it stores: Any number that doesn't contain decimal points

### Float
Type in c: `float`
What it stores: Any number, can also contain decimals
