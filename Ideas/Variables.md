## Definition 
A Variable in C is anything that stores a value, whether its a number, some text, a single letter, or a decimal number (they are different sadly)

Some example definitions
```c
int i = 0;
long i = 0l;

float f = 0.0f;
double d = 0.0;

char c = 'A';
char* str = "Hello World";

```

there are a lot of new words and symbols in that block of code so let me break down a variable declaration in

## Types

### Boolean
