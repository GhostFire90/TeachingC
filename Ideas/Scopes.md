Common phases that will be used in this "course" reference scope, such as

So what is a scope?

## What is it
Think of a scope as a little box that you open, put things in and close.
Every scope has:
1. A beginning (Opening the box)
2. A body (putting things in and doing things with the things inside the box)
3. An end (closing the box)
